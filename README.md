### WebRTC:-

WebRTC is a free, open-source project that provides web browsers and mobile applications with
real-time communication via simple application programming interfaces (APIs). It allows audio and
video communication to work inside web pages by allowing direct peer-to-peer communication,
eliminating the need to install plugins or download native apps.

#### Peer

A peer is a WebRTC client that communicates with other peers to exchange media streams. A peer can
be a browser, a native application, or an IoT device.

#### NAT

Network Address Translation (NAT) is a method used to remap one IP address space into another by
modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a
traffic routing device.

#### STUN

Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a standardized set of methods and a network protocol
to enable an end host to discover its public IP address if it is located behind a NAT. It is used to
aid in the discovery of other peers in a network.

#### TURN

Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) is a protocol that assists in the traversal of network. It
is used to relay media when a direct peer-to-peer connection cannot be established.

#### Signalling

Signalling is the process of coordinating communication between peers. It is used to exchange the
necessary information to establish a connection.

### Firebase:-

Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. It provides a
set of tools and services that help developers build and grow their applications.

#### Realtime Database

Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets you store and sync data
between your users in real-time.
It is commonly used to build collaborative applications like social media, games, and chat apps.

#### Authentication

Firebase Authentication provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to
authenticate users to your app.
